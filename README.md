# Predict-Lung-Disease-through-Chest-X-Ray
We obtain this repository by refactoring the [code](https://github.com/Azure/AzureChestXRay) for the blog post [Using Microsoft AI to Build a Lung-Disease Prediction Model using Chest X-Ray Images](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/03/07/using-microsoft-ai-to-build-a-lung-disease-prediction-model-using-chest-x-ray-images/). This instruction aims to help newcomers build the system in a vary short time.
