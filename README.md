# Detect-pulmonary-disease-through-Chest-X-ray
This repository trains a deep learning model which has the ability to detect 14 kinds of pulmonary diseases by analyzing the input chest X-ray image. We refactoried the [code](https://github.com/Azure/AzureChestXRay) for the blog post [Using Microsoft AI to Build a Lung-Disease Prediction Model using Chest X-Ray Images](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/03/07/using-microsoft-ai-to-build-a-lung-disease-prediction-model-using-chest-x-ray-images/) in order to make it clear an friendly to newcomers.
